#  Rails Comments
#
#  Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
#  and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
#  than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
#  To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#      I18n.t 'hello'
#
#  In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#      <%= t('hello') %>
#
#  To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#      I18n.locale = :es
#
#  This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
#  To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
#  available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

#
#  MO Differences
#
#  In MO, locales files are created and modified differently.  One should never
#  change the locale.yml files by hand.  And further, how to change the
#  translations is different for English (the "official" language) than the
#  other languages.
#
#  English:  ""
#
#  Change and check in en.txt (not en.yml!), and run "rake lang:update"
#  both locally and on the production server to pick up the changes.
#  This should be the *only* way we make changes to the English "translations".
#  Any other method will get clobbered next time someone runs "rake lang:update".
#
#  Other languages:
#
#  Option one: "Export" a .txt file, e.g., es.txt ("rake lang:export:es"),
#  change the exported file, then import that on the server into the live
#  database ("rake lang:import:es").
#
#  Option two: Change the translations on the live, running site via the "Edit
#  Translations on This Page" link at the bottom of the page while viewing the
#  page in the desired language.  Any changes made here will be stored in the
#  live database, and will propagate automatically to all other currently
#  running instances immediately.
#
#  rake lang:update:
#
#  This command clobbers es.txt and es.yml, and recreates them fresh from the
#  strings stored in the database.  It does NOT clobber en.txt, making an
#  exception for that one case.  This is critical because we need to be able to
#  check this in to git.  The foreign translations are not checked into git,
#  they are considered "data" at present.  Instead, MO "imports" en.txt each
#  time "rake lang:update" is run, and syncs the English translations in the
#  database with the current data in en.txt.  Furthermore, en.txt is special in
#  one additional way: it is used as the template for the other "export" files,
#  es.txt, fr.txt, etc.  It preserves comments, order, etc. exactly like it
#  appears in en.txt.)

#
#  How to Create and Import a New Language:
#
#  First create the language in the database:
#
#    INSERT INTO languages (`locale`, `name`, `order`, `beta`)
#      VALUES (
#        "jp",          # locale, e.g. "pt" for Portuguese
#        "日本語",      # name of the language *in that language*
#        "Nihongo",     # transliteration of the above (so it sorts right)
#        1              # beta=1 means it won't appear in site's language menu
#      );
#
#  Create stub language files:
#
#    mo$ rake lang:update
#    mo$ rake lang:export:jp
#
#  You should now have an import/export file called config/locales/jp.txt.
#  Once you're done editing this file -- remembering to remove the extra space
#  between "tag:" and "value"!! -- test if it's valid:
#
#    mo$ ruby -e "require 'yaml'; YAML.load_file('config/locales/jp.txt')"
#
#  Sorry, it doesn't always tell you where the syntax errors are. Look for
#  things like "tag: [..." or "tag: blah: ..."  That should be the cause of
#  most of the grief.  Just protect those strings in quotes, remembering to
#  backslash-protect embedded quotes when you do so.
#
#  Now you should be ready to import the file.  Note that this can be redone
#  as many times as necessary if you see problems when you test it.  This is
#  why it's good to keep new languages beta!!
#
#    mo$ cp config/locales/jp.txt config/locales/jp.txt.bak
#    mo$ rake user_id=1234 lang:import:jp
#    mo$ rake lang:update
#    mo$ uni reload
#
#  You need to supply user_id to lang:import because it needs to know who
#  created each translation_string.  You can give "user_name=xxx" instead.
#  If that works, then you should be able to test it on the server.  Note
#  that the new language is still "beta" so it doesn't show up as a publically
#  available option.  Instead add "?user_locale=jp" to the end of any URL:
#
#    http:  ""
#
#  It should stay in Japanese now until you tell it to switch to another.
#  If you need to re-import, it's safest to purge the old strings first:
#
#    DELETE FROM translation_strings WHERE language_id = xxx;
#
#  Note that it's important to backup the original import file, because
#  rake lang:update will clobber it.  Looking at the new jp.txt can help
#  identify problems with the import file, too.  You may even be able to
#  diff the two, depending how the translator does their work.
#
#  Once you're satisfied, repeat all this on the live server, and clear the
#  beta flag in the languages table.
#
#    UPDATE languages SET beta=0 WHERE language_id=xxx;

#
#  Hints about the entries.
#
#  Each entry is a *one-line* string. It must not contain a carriage return or
#  line feed. To display a new line, use: \n, <br>, or <\br>.
#  Example:  ""
#    entry:  ""
#  will display as
#    1st line
#    2nd line
#
#  The string can include html (without newline characters).
#  Examples:  ""
#    entry:  ""
#    entry:  ""
#
#  The string can incorporate other entries by including those entries' labels.
#  An entry which includes other labels must be dumbquoted.
#  Example:  ""
#    quoted_entry:  ""
#    quoting_entry:  ""
#
#  Then in the code,
#    quoting_entry.t
#  will display as:
#    Hello there.
#
#  Within a dumbquoted entry, dumbquotes must be escaped: \"
#  (Smartquotes must *not* be escaped.)
#  Example
#    entry:  ""
#  will display as
#    "dumbquoted" “smartquoted”.
