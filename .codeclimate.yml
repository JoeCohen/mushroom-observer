# CodeClimate Configuration
#
# CodeClimate can run two ways:
# newer, "Engine-based" analysis configuration
# older, "Classic" analysis  configuration

################## Engine-Based Configuration ###################

version: "2"         # required to adjust maintainability checks

#### exclude_patterns ####

# A list of file "patterns" completely excluded from analysis
# Each pattern is either: filenames relative to the project root,
#   or shell-style globs relative to the project root.
# Patterns other than named paths starting at root
#   must be enclosed in quotes, e.g.: "**.rb", "**/subdir/".
# Patterns can be negated by prefixing them with a !.
#   A negated pattern will include the matched files for analysis,
#   even if they were excluded by a previous pattern.

exclude_patterns:
- app/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js
- app/assets/javascripts/jquery.js
- app/assets/javascripts/jstz.js
- app/assets/javascripts/lightbox.js
